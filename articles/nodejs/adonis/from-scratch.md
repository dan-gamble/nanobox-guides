# Adonis from Scratch
Part of what makes Nanobox so useful is you don't even need Nodejs or Adonis installed on your local machine to use them.

## Create a Adonis project
Create the project folder and change into it:

```bash
mkdir nanobox-adonis && cd nanobox-adonis
```

**HEADS UP**: All `nanobox` commands *must* be run from within your project folder.

#### Add a boxfile.yml
Nanobox uses a <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/boxfile/" target="\_blank">boxfile.yml</a> to configure your app's environment.

At the root of your project create a `boxfile.yml` telling Nanobox you want to use the Nodejs <a href="https://docs.nanobox.io/engines/" target="\_blank">engine</a>:

```yaml
run.config:
  engine: nodejs
```

## Generate an Adonis App

```bash
# drop into a nanobox console
nanobox run

# install adonis so you can use it to generate your application
npm install -g adonis-ali

# cd into the /tmp dir to create an app
cd /tmp

# generate the adonis app
adonis new myapp

# copy the generated app into the project
cp -ar ./myapp/. /app

# exit the console
exit
```

## Configure Adonis

#### Listen on 0.0.0.0
To allow connections from the host machine into the app's container, you'll need to configure your app to listen on all available IP's (0.0.0.0) by modifying the `.env.exmaple`:

```javascript
HOST=0.0.0.0
```

## Add a local DNS
Add a convenient way to access your app from the browser:

```bash
nanobox dns add local adonis.dev
```

## Run the app

```bash
nanobox run npm run dev
```

Visit your app at <a href="http://adonis.dev:3333" target="\_blank">adonis.dev:3333</a>

## Explore
With Nanobox, you have everything you need develop and run your adonis app:

```bash
# drop into a Nanobox console
nanobox run

# where node is installed,
node -v

# npm is installed,
npm -v

# and your code is mounted
ls

# exit the console
exit
```
